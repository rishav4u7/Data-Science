# Lead Score:

- An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.
- The company requires us to build a model wherein lead score need to be assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
- Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.

## Dataset Information

Link: [Lead Dataset]( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V1tL3-PvaFwSeHJ4DuF9K3-yP6B6ImSm?usp=sharing)

The leads dataset from the past contains around 9000 data points. This dataset consists of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. which may or may not be useful in ultimately deciding whether a lead will be converted or not. The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted or not wherein 1 means it was converted and 0 means it wasn’t converted. You can learn more about the dataset from the data dictionary provided in the above link.
