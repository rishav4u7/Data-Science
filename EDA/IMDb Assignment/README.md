# IMDb Movie Data Visualisation

The dataset contains the data of 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this assignment, we tried finding some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.


## Dataset Information

Please refer the [csv](https://github.com/rishav4u7/Data-Science/blob/master/EDA/IMDb%20Assignment/Movie%2BAssignment%2BData%2BDictionary.xlsx) 
and [xlsv](https://github.com/rishav4u7/Data-Science/blob/master/EDA/IMDb%20Assignment/Movie%2BAssignment%2BData.csv) files provided above for the dataset and its information. The dataset contains the 100 best performing movies with 62 column attributes/features from the year 2010 to 2016.
## Result
In this project we found various insights by performing several different tasks on the dataset. They are:
- Top 5 popular actor trios by checking various parameter such as Actorâ€™s Popularity on Social Media and Profit earned by the movie in which they acted as a trio.
- Kids are fan of the movie Deadpool
- Top 1000 voters voted most for Sci-Fi movies.
- Romance movies are given the least vote.
- Sci-Fi movies are more liked by all the age groups of males and females as well as by the top1000 voters of IMDb.
- Action and Thriller movies are also quite popular among top1000 voters of IMDb and different age groups of males.
- And many more.
